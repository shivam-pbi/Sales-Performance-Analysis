## üîç Purpose

The primary goal of this dashboard was to:
- Provide a **comprehensive overview of sales performance** across products, regions, and salespersons.
- Track **target vs actual sales**, profit margins, and YoY growth to assess team efficiency.
- Perform **deep customer segmentation** using RFM and CLV analytics.
- Identify **top-performing states, product sub-categories, and salespeople**.
- Enable **what-if simulations** to evaluate pricing and discounting strategies.

---

## üéØ Business Impact

- Helped identify **top 35% of customers** who contribute **~67% of total sales**, aiding retention focus.
- Enabled **real-time sales target tracking**, with a 98.98% target achievement rate across 2021.
- Revealed high-return sub-categories and **states with below-average profit margins**, guiding inventory decisions.
- Assisted sales leaders in **ranking high/low performers**, refining incentive planning.
- Allowed scenario modeling with **discount simulations**, projecting margins under multiple conditions.
